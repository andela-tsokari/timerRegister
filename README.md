# CountDown Timers App

##About

On the 5th of March, I began learning AngularJS.

This application is being built using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) framework.
It is an application done using CRUD principles.
The features include:

1. **Add Timer:** In this, a user can add a timer. giving it a duration (in hours, minutes and seconds). This timer(s) is stored in a "Your Timers" tab.

2. **Start Timer:** Start a Countdown Timer using the preset duration. This instantiates a Running Timer with a countdown. 

	For now, the running timer alerts on completion and deletes itself. Other possibilities will be added. 

3. **Edit/Update Timer:** Timer Duration can be edited permanently in the "Your Timers" tab, or/and a Running Timer can be edited temporarily in the "Running Timer(s)" tab. 

4. **Delete Timer:** A previously saved timer in "Your Timer(s)" or "Running Timer(s)" tab can be deleted.

	**N.B.:** Editing of Timer Name is not allowed because this will duplicate the Add New Timer feature. Perhaps, I may review this when timer options are available. Do let me know if you'd like the feature added.


##Viewing

For now, this is a solo project. Later on, I may be inclined to allow collaborators.

You may view progress of this app via its gh-pages [here](http://andela-tsokari.github.io/timers).
